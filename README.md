# Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

This notebook focuses on item-based collaborative filtering, which involves identifying similarities between items. To achieve this, we use techniques like cosine similarity to measure the similarity between pairs of items in the dataset. Cosine similarity is a common method used to compute similarity scores between items based on their feature vectors.

In summary, item-based collaborative filtering enables us to recommend similar items to users based on their interactions with other items. By leveraging the similarities between items, we can provide personalized recommendations that align with users' preferences and interests.
